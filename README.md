Currently, I am developing my research activity in the area of remote sensing for forestry applications in Mediterranean ecosystems, both for inventory and for early detection and control of forest fires and for analyzing the physiological state of the vegetation, all through remote sensing using LiDAR, images of very high spatial resolution, or drone flights with multispectral or thermal imaging
