### Hi there! This is Maria Angeles VaroðŸ‘‹

#### A passionate of Forestry Systems

I'm Maria Angeles Varo, a forestry engineer with expertise in geomatics. I'm a researcher in the University of CÃ³rdoba, Spain. I feel fascinated about how the forest can be translate into numbers with significative meaning so they can be understood easily.

Currently, I am developing my research activity in the area of remote sensing for forestry applications in Mediterranean ecosystems, both for inventory and for early detection and control of forest fires and for analyzing the physiological state of the vegetation, all through remote sensing using LiDAR, images of very high spatial resolution, or drone flights with multispectral or thermal imaging

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **R** for **LiDAR** and **Remote Sensing** in Silviculture and Forestry Management.
